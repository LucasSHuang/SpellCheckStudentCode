| Sep 25 |  1-1:30pm   | I began thinking about the problem in a way where you could create a number for each word and then when you find the word you use a map to check if the word matches the word at that spot in the array I think the main challenge with this would be that you would need to find out what the number of the word you are trying to check would be. Maybe I could make an array and put the ASCII number for each letter in its array and then compare that, but I feel like that doesn't make the code very fluent. I will continue thinking about this problem later. |

However, I am a bit confused on whether to just iterate through the dictionary or to have a specific number for each word. I think right now I'm leaning towards doing it for each word individually and then finding a way to check after that. |
| Sep 29 | 8:30-9:30pm |            I pivoted away from the way I was thinking about it before and decided to just try binary search for now to see if that would work. I didn't really feel like writing out all of the binary sort code so I searched up if there was anyway to simplify it in Java and to my surprise there actually was. It just returns the index of where the word is found and if it isn't it just returns -1 which is really nice. I just used that and got 4 out of the 5 right but of course the one with rome will be tough so I need to figure out a way to do that. |
