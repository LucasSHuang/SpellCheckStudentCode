| Sep 25 | 1-1:30pm | I began thinking about the problem in a way where you could create a number for each word and then when you find the word you use a map to check if the word matches the word at that spot in the array I think the main challenge with this would be that you would need to find out what the number of the word you are trying to check would be. Maybe I could make an array and put the ASCII number for each letter in its array and then compare that, but I feel like that doesn't make the code very fluent. I will continue thinking about this problem later. |
