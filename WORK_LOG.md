| Sep 25 | 1-1:30pm | I began thinking about the problem in a way where you could create a number for each word and then when you find the word you use a map to check if the word matches the word at that spot in the array I think the main challenge with this would be that you would need to find out what the number of the word you are trying to check would be. Maybe I could make an array and put the ASCII number for each letter in its array and then compare that, but I feel like that doesn't make the code very fluent. I will continue thinking about this problem later. |

However, I am a bit confused on whether to just iterate through the dictionary or to have a specific number for each word. I think right now I'm leaning towards doing it for each word individually and then finding a way to check after that.  |
