| Sep 25 |   1-1:30pm   | I began thinking about the problem in a way where you could create a number for each word and then when you find the word you use a map to check if the word matches the word at that spot in the array I think the main challenge with this would be that you would need to find out what the number of the word you are trying to check would be. Maybe I could make an array and put the ASCII number for each letter in its array and then compare that, but I feel like that doesn't make the code very fluent. I will continue thinking about this problem later. |
| Sep 29 |  11-11:30am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I tried to start implementing the process of making a specific number for each word. However, I am a bit confused on whether to just iterate through the dictionary or to have a specific number for each word. I think right now I'm leaning towards doing it for each word individually and then finding a way to check after that. |
| Sep 29 | 8:30-9:30pm  |            I pivoted away from the way I was thinking about it before and decided to just try binary search for now to see if that would work. I didn't really feel like writing out all of the binary sort code so I searched up if there was anyway to simplify it in Java and to my surprise there actually was. It just returns the index of where the word is found and if it isn't it just returns -1 which is really nice. I just used that and got 4 out of the 5 right but of course the one with rome will be tough so I need to figure out a way to do that. |
| Sep 30 | 7:30-8:30pm  |                                                                                                                                           I'm trying to think of ways that I could make the binary sort quicker in general. I think the best way for that is finding the first letter of the word you are checking and then having constants for when that letter in the dictionary starts in finishes which greatly shortens the amount you have to search through. I feel like this is a lot of work though so I am pretty sure this is the wrong way to go about it. |
| Oct 3  |   5:30-6pm   |                                                                                                                                                   I began working on implementing the trie and node classes to complete the spell check. I initially completed the node getters and setters but then realized as I went on in the trie class that I needed to actually get and set the child so I changed that. So far in the trie class I have gotten to finishing the insert method and I will try to complete the method where you find if the word is valid or not. |
| Oct 5  |    5-6pm     |                                                                                       I "finished" the trie class. The find method was essentially the same as the insert method but instead you are check to see if the word is valid, which makes sense based on the stuff we did in class. However, one thing that is a little confusing is that there is a index out of bounds error for a length 26. I thought it had to do with punctuation so I added a check in the insert part but that didn't work the way I wanted it too. I will try some other stuff later |

Turns out the reason for the index out of bounds was because I set the array size in the node class to 26 instead of 256 to cover all the acii values. Then I realized that I used contain in my spellcheck method so I added another trie to keep track instead which made it much faster. |
| Oct 9  |  11-11:50am  |                                                                                                      I finished the TST method. I initially was using a for loop like I did in the trie but I found it really weird to do it that way since there are times you don't want to go to the next letter. Therefore, I switched to a while loop so it gave me more freedom to increment my variable for the index when I wanted to. This really helped me get through everything and from that it was pretty easy as it was just putting my knowledge of TST into code form. |
